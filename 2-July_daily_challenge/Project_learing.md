# ✅ Progress Report - July 1st, 2025

## 🧠 What I Learned and Implemented Today:

### 📅 Appointment Management Features (MERN Stack - Doctor Panel)

Today, I implemented two major features in my **AiSmartHealthcareSystem**:

---

### 🔴 1. Pending Appointments (Doctor Panel)

- Created a `PendingAppointment` React component.
- Used `useEffect` and `axios` to:
  - Fetch doctor profile using JWT token.
  - Fetch all doctor appointments from the backend.
- Filtered only pending appointments (`isCompleted === false`).
- Rendered all pending appointments in a styled list with:
  - Patient name, email, date, time, and description.
  - “Join Video Call” link if `roomId` exists.
  - Test report link (if uploaded), else shown as “No report yet”.

---

### ✅ 2. Completed Appointments (Doctor Panel)

- Reused logic from the pending appointments component.
- Filtered appointments where `isCompleted === true`.
- Displayed them with success badges for “Appointment Completed”.

---

### 🛠 Backend Update Summary

- Used existing API: `GET /api/appointments/doctor/:doctorId`
- Filtered response on frontend for pending or completed status.
- Ensured JWT token is passed securely for authentication.

---

### ✨ Skills Strengthened Today

- Working with protected routes using JWT.
- Deep understanding of conditional rendering in React.
- Mastery over filtering data arrays based on flags like `isCompleted`.
- Confidence in using Axios with Bearer tokens and dynamic URLs.
- Used Tailwind CSS to give a clean UI with color indicators.
