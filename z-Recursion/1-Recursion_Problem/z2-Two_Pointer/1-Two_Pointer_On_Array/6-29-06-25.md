## ✅ Question: Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted

You are given an array of integers `numbers` that is **sorted in non-decreasing order**.

Return the indices **(1-indexed)** of two numbers `[index1, index2]`, such that they **add up to a given `target`** number and `index1 < index2`.

You **may not use the same element twice**.

There is always exactly **one valid solution**.

Your solution must use **O(1) additional space**.

---

### 📥 Example

**Input:**

```
numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
```

**Output:**

```
[1, 2]
```

**Explanation:**
The numbers at indices 1 and 2 (1-based) are 2 and 7, and they sum up to 9.

---

## 🔧 Pseudocode

```
1. Initialize two pointers: l = 0, r = numbers.size() - 1
2. While l < r:
   a. sum = numbers[l] + numbers[r]
   b. If sum == target => return [l+1, r+1]
   c. If sum < target => l++ (we need a larger number)
   d. If sum > target => r-- (we need a smaller number)
```

## 💡 What Did I Learn from This Question?

* ✅ Refreshed understanding of **two pointer approach** in sorted arrays.
* ✅ Practiced the constraint of returning **1-indexed results**.
* ✅ Learned how to achieve **O(1) space** complexity by using just index pointers.
* ✅ Useful in real-world scenarios where space is limited.

## 🧑‍💻 Code Snippet (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        int l = 0, r = numbers.size() - 1;

        while (l < r) {
            int curSum = numbers[l] + numbers[r];

            if (curSum > target) {
                r--;
            } else if (curSum < target) {
                l++;
            } else {
                return { l + 1, r + 1 }; // 1-indexed result
            }
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```
