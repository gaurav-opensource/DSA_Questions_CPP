# 🧩 DSA Question - Merge Two 2D Arrays by ID

## 📌 Problem Statement:
You are given two 2D integer vectors `nums1` and `nums2` of the form `{id, value}`.  
Merge them such that:
- If IDs match → sum the values.
- If not → keep both IDs and values.
- Result must be sorted by ID.

## ✅ Pseudocode (Correct Logic)

```cpp
Initialize result as empty vector

left = 0, right = 0

while left < nums1.size() and right < nums2.size():
    id1 = nums1[left][0]
    id2 = nums2[right][0]

    if id1 == id2:
        sum = nums1[left][1] + nums2[right][1]
        result.push_back({id1, sum})
        left++, right++

    else if id1 < id2:
        result.push_back({id1, nums1[left][1]})
        left++

    else:
        result.push_back({id2, nums2[right][1]})
        right++

# Remaining elements
while left < nums1.size():
    result.push_back({nums1[left][0], nums1[left][1]})
    left++

while right < nums2.size():
    result.push_back({nums2[right][0], nums2[right][1]})
    right++





# ❌ Common Mistakes in 2D Vector Merge Code (C++)

This file highlights common errors made while merging two 2D vectors and their proper fixes.

---

## ❌ Mistake 1: Accessing Uninitialized Vector Index

```cpp
result[i][0] = id;
```

### 🔴 Problem:

You're accessing `result[i][0]` directly without allocating memory for that row, which leads to runtime error or garbage values.

### ✅ Fix:

Use `push_back()` to add a new row dynamically.

```cpp
result.push_back({id, value});
```

---

## ❌ Mistake 2: Using Wrong Index with Wrong Vector

```cpp
nums2[left][1];
```

### 🔴 Problem:

Here, `left` belongs to `nums1` but is mistakenly used for `nums2`.

### ✅ Fix:

Always use correct indices with correct vectors.

```cpp
nums1[left][1];  // when processing nums1
nums2[right][1]; // when processing nums2
```

---

## ❌ Mistake 3: Wrong Loop Condition for Remaining Elements

```cpp
if (right < n)
```

### 🔴 Problem:

Using `n` (size of nums1) to check for `nums2` remainder is logically incorrect.

### ✅ Fix:

Use the correct variable for size check.

```cpp
if (right < m) // where m = nums2.size()
```

---

## ❌ Mistake 4: Trying to Assign Without Memory

```cpp
result[left][0] = id;
```

### 🔴 Problem:

You’re trying to assign to a 2D vector cell that doesn't exist yet.

### ✅ Fix:

Use `push_back` to create new rows safely.

```cpp
result.push_back({id, value});
```

---

## ✅ Summary

* Always use `.push_back()` with vectors when growing them.
* Never access an index that hasn’t been initialized.
* Use correct loop boundaries for remaining data.
* Match your vector (`nums1`, `nums2`) with the correct pointer (`left`, `right`).
