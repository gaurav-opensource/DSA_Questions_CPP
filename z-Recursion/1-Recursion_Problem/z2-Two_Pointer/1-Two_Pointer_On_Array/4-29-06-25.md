## ✅ Question: Find Maximum Pair Sum Less Than K

You are given an array `arr` of size `N` and an integer `K`. The task is to find the **pair of integers (a, b)** in the array such that:

* Their sum is **less than K**, and
* Among all such pairs, the sum **a + b** is **maximum possible**.

Return the pair `(a, b)`. If no such pair exists, return `(-1, -1)`.

---

### 📥 Example

**Input:**

```
arr = [2, 4, 3, 7, 5], K = 10
```

**Output:**

```
(4, 5)
```

**Explanation:**
All pairs with sum < 10:

* (2, 3) = 5
* (2, 4) = 6
* (2, 5) = 7
* (2, 7) = 9
* (3, 4) = 7
* (3, 5) = 8
* (3, 7) = 10 (not valid)
* (4, 5) = 9 ✅
* (4, 7) = 11 ❌
* (5, 7) = 12 ❌

So the maximum valid sum is 9 from pair (4, 5).

## 🔧 Pseudocode

```
1. Sort the array.
2. Initialize two pointers: l = 0, r = n - 1
3. Initialize maxSum = 0 and result = (-1, -1)
4. While l < r:
    - currSum = arr[l] + arr[r]
    - If currSum < k:
        - If currSum > maxSum:
            - Update maxSum and result = (arr[l], arr[r])
        - Move l++ to try a larger value
    - Else:
        - Move r-- to try a smaller value
5. Return result
```

## 💡 What Did I Learn from This Question?

* ✅ Practiced the **two pointers approach** efficiently on a sorted array.
* ✅ Understood how to find a pair under a constraint (sum < K) and still maximize a condition.
* ✅ Learned how sorting helps in narrowing the search range.
* ✅ Reviewed pair formation and pointer movement logic.

## 🧑‍💻 Code Snippet (C++)

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    pair<int, int> maxSum(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        int l = 0;
        int r = arr.size() - 1;
        int a = -1, b = -1;
        int maxSum = 0;

        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());

        while (l < r) {
            int currSum = arr[l] + arr[r];
            if (currSum < k) {
                if (currSum > maxSum) {
                    maxSum = currSum;
                    a = arr[l];
                    b = arr[r];
                }
                l++; // Try to increase the sum
            } else {
                r--; // Try to decrease the sum
            }
        }

        return {a, b};
    }
};
```
