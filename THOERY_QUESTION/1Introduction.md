# Self Introduction for HR Round

**Hi, I’m Gaurav Yadav. It’s great to meet you! I’m currently in my third year of B.Tech in Computer Science from HCST Farah, Mathura. I’m passionate about building software that solves real-world problems.**

Throughout/During my academic journey, I’ve worked on several projects, including a healthcare web platform where users can consult with doctors online, and a computer vision-based system that controls the cursor using hand gestures.

Recently, I completed a remote internship at **UPMC** as a Full Stack Developer, where I worked on backend APIs for real-time features like chat and video calls using **Socket.IO**.

Alongside development, I regularly practice **data structures and algorithms in Java** and enjoy solving technical challenges.

I enjoy working with others and look forward to learning and contributing wherever I can.

**This is all about me.**

# Self Introduction for Technical Round

**Hello, I’m Gaurav Yadav, currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science. I’ve built a strong understanding of core subjects like Data Structures, OOPs, DBMS, OS, and CN through academics and practical projects.**

I recently completed a 1-month remote internship at **UPMC**, where I worked on backend API development for a real-time chat and video calling application. This gave me hands-on experience with building and integrating scalable backend services.

I’ve also developed independent projects like a healthcare platform using the **MERN stack**, where users can book appointments, upload reports, and chat with doctors. Another project was a **machine learning-based cursor control system** using finger gestures via **OpenCV**.

My tech stack includes **Java, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Python**. I’ve worked with **Socket.IO, Cloudinary, and Razorpay** for real-time communication, media uploads, and payments.

I’m currently exploring **system design** and contributing to **open-source projects**.

**This is all about me.**
